# foo_trackpos

This component for foobar2000 provides a new context menu item
"place after current playing" that allows you to place the selected tracks
after the currently playing one in the playing playlist. It comes with
various settings that allow you to change its behavior, like having your
tracks moved or copied or having them enqueued if the playing playlist is
locked.

This is very useful as a default doubleclick action for components like
database search, album list or foo_chronflow.
